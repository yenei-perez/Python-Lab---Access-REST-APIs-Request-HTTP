# Python Lab - Access REST APIs & Request HTTP

When you, the client, access a web page your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server that hosts the page. If no specific file is mentioned in the URL, the server typically looks for a default file, such as "index.html". If your request is successful, the server will send the object to the client in an HTTP response. This includes information like the type of the resource, the length of the resource, and other information.

The HTTP protocol allows you to send and receive information through the web including webpages, images, and other web resources. In this lab, we will provide an overview of the Requests library for interacting with the HTTP protocol.
